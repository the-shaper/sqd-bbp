# Beyond Bullet Points - MVP Implementation Plan

**Status:** Phase 4 COMPLETE ✅ | Real-time Multiplayer Active

**Last Updated:** 2026-03-16

## Goal
Create a working prototype (MVP) for the Beyond Bullet Points Exercise that Shahid can share and test among peers and BDO executives. The tool helps structure presentations using the "Beyond Bulletpoints" methodology through an AI-assisted canvas interface.

---

## Project Overview

### What is "Beyond Bullet Points"?
**Beyond Bullet Points** is a storytelling methodology for creating compelling presentations that move beyond dry, bullet-pointed slides. Instead of listing facts, it structures presentations as a narrative journey that engages the audience emotionally and intellectually.

### The 6-Column Story Framework
The tool uses a 6-column canvas to structure presentations:

1. **Place** - The setting/situation where the story begins
2. **Role** - The audience's role/part in the narrative
3. **Challenge** - The obstacle or problem to overcome
4. **Point A** - The current state (where we are now)
5. **Point B** - The desired destination (where we need to be)
6. **Change** - The transformation required to get from A to B

When connected in sequence, these elements form a complete transformation story.

### Who Is This For?
- **Primary:** BDO executives and corporate consultancy teams
- **Secondary:** Internal design consultancy teams
- **Use Case:** Client presentations, workshop facilitation, strategic storytelling

### How It Works
1. **Admin** logs in and creates a session (with optional password protection)
2. **Admin** completes the "New Project" onboarding (client info, background, AI-assisted idea generation)
3. **Admin** shares the session URL with team members: `website.com/bdo-xxxx`
4. **Players** access the session and collaborate on the canvas
5. **Cards** are organized across the 6 columns to build the narrative
6. **Connections** between cards create story flows
7. **Export** the final story as ZIP, Markdown, or JSON

### Key Features
- 🔐 **Password Protection:** Optional session-level passwords for sensitive projects
- 🤖 **AI Integration:** Generate ideas using Gemini or Opencode models
- 🎨 **Visual Canvas:** Drag-and-drop interface with 6 columns
- 🔗 **Story Flows:** Connect cards to create narrative sequences
- 📤 **Export:** Download sessions as AI-readable Markdown files
- 👥 **Collaboration:** Real-time multiplayer (Phase 4)

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Express + SQLite + better-sqlite3
- **Storage:** Hybrid (SQLite index + Markdown files)
- **AI:** Google Gemini API + Opencode API
- **Real-time:** PartyKit (coming in Phase 4)

## REVISED Architecture (Updated 2026-03-15)

### Authentication & User Roles

**Admin (Global Access)**
- Password: `shazam!` (set via env variable `ADMIN_PASSWORD`)
- Login once at `/` to access entire system
- Can create/manage all sessions
- Bypasses all session passwords automatically
- Only role that can do onboarding (New Project flow)
- Sees dashboard with all sessions after login

**Players/Guests (Session Access)**
- Access via direct URL: `website.com/bdo-xxxx`
- Can view session without any authentication
- Can edit only if:
  - Session has no password (open), OR
  - Session has password and they enter it correctly
- Never see onboarding - only the completed canvas

**Future Roles (Post-MVP)**
- Lead Guest: Could do onboarding if delegated by admin
- Standard Guest: View/edit only, no onboarding

---

### URL Structure

```
/                    → Admin login page (if not logged in)
/                    → Admin dashboard (if logged in)
/bdo-xxxx            → Session view (onboarding if not done, else canvas)
/bdo-xxxx?mode=edit  → Attempt edit mode (may require password)
```

---

### Session Creation Flow

1. **Admin clicks "Create Session"**
   - Prompt: "Session name?"
   - Prompt: "Require password for players? (yes/no)"
     - If YES: Auto-generate hex password, show to admin
     - If NO: Session is open (no password required)
   - Session created, auto-redirects to `/bdo-xxxx`

2. **Onboarding Phase (Admin Only)**
   - Session starts in "New Project" view (onboarding)
   - Players trying to access see: "Session setup in progress"
   - Admin completes: client, background, AI generation
   - Onboarding completion creates initial cards
   - Then canvas appears for everyone

3. **Player Access**
   - If onboarding not done: See "Setup in progress" message
   - If onboarding done: See canvas immediately
   - If session has password: Prompt for password on edit attempt

---

## Core Architecture: Hybrid File System + SQLite

### File Structure
```
/data/
  /sessions/
    /{sessionId}/                    # e.g., /sessions/bdo-k4d3/
      ├── session.json               # Session metadata, project info
      ├── cards-index.json           # Fast lookup index for cards
      ├── connections.json           # Card relationship graph
      └── cards/                     # Individual card files (Markdown)
          ├── place-001.md
          ├── role-001.md
          └── story-001.md
```

### Card Format (Markdown with YAML Frontmatter)
```markdown
---
id: place-001
section: place
createdAt: '2026-03-14T10:30:00Z'
updatedAt: '2026-03-14T11:15:00Z'
starred: true
order: 1
---

They are at a crossroads in their business...
```

**Why this structure:**
- ✅ AI-readable: LLMs process Markdown natively with YAML context
- ✅ Export-friendly: ZIP the folder or concatenate files
- ✅ Human-readable: Files can be opened in any text editor
- ✅ Flexible: Easy to transform to PDF, PowerPoint, or other formats

## Notes for Future (Post-MVP)

**Lead Guest Concept:**
- One "lead" participant per session who can:
  - Do onboarding if admin delegates
  - Manage the session flow
  - Kick/ban disruptive users
- Admin can promote any participant to lead

**Multiplayer Onboarding Ideas:**
- Option A: Collaborative onboarding (everyone contributes)
- Option B: Locked until admin finishes, then unlocked
- Option C: Template-based (skip onboarding, use preset)

---

**Last Updated:** 2026-03-15
**Status:** Phase 3 COMPLETE ✅ | Ready for Phase 4 (Multiplayer)
**Next Step:** Implement PartyKit for real-time multiplayer sync
