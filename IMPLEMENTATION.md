## 2025-04-25 — Slice B: Role-aware beta UX

### Summary
Centralized auth state, removed the sidebar for non-admins, added a compact sidebar mode, and introduced a top-bar help entry point with a swappable video-provider seam.

### Decisions
- **Auth context first, then UI:** Instead of hiding the sidebar with CSS, we removed it from the DOM entirely (`return null`) so non-admin layouts never reserve dead space.
- **Compact mode persisted locally:** `localStorage` key `bbp_sidebar_compact`. No backend needed.
- **Help icon is a placeholder seam:** The dropdown uses an abstract `TUTORIALS` array. The backing video provider (Mux, YouTube, self-hosted) can be swapped later by updating the array and the click handler.
- **Type-check-first workflow:** All changes were validated with `npm run lint` and `npm run build` before being considered complete.

### Files changed
| File | What changed |
|------|-------------|
| `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` | **New.** Centralizes admin auth: `adminSessionId`, `isAdminVerified`, `verifyAdminSession`, `login`, `logout`, re-verify on focus/visibilitychange. |
| `src/App.tsx` | Refactored to consume `useAuth()`. Removed inline auth state. Dashboard and SessionView are now inner components inside `AppRoutes`. |
| `src/components/LoginPage.tsx` | Now uses `useAuth().login()` instead of receiving an `onLogin` prop. |
| `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` | Returns `null` when `!isAdmin`. Added compact mode (`w-16` collapsed bar) with `PanelLeftClose` / `PanelLeft` toggle. State persisted to `localStorage`. |
| `src/components/TopBar.tsx` | Added help icon (`HelpCircle`) with a dropdown tutorial list. Abstract `TUTORIALS` constant allows provider swap later. |

### 2025-04-25 — Quick win: Help icon swap
- Replaced `HelpCircle` with `Play` icon in `TopBar.tsx` for the tutorial dropdown toggle.

## 2025-04-25 — Slice E: Canvas behavior refinement (partial)

### Summary
Updated AI prompts to target 100-character card sentences and added a live Twitter-like character counter to card editors.

### Decisions
- **Guidance, not validation:** The counter shows "X / 100" and a soft "You are past 100 characters" notice when exceeded, but typing is never blocked.
- **Enter edit mode on focus:** Empty cards now enter inline edit mode immediately when the textarea receives focus, so the counter is always visible during typing.
- **Both editing paths covered:** The counter appears in the `editingCardId === card.id` branch, which handles both new card creation and double-click editing.

### Files changed
| File | What changed |
|------|-------------|
| `src/services/ai.ts` | Added "maximum 100 characters" constraint to `generateCards()` and `generateSingleIdea()` prompts. |
| `src/components/Canvas.tsx` | Added live character counter in lower-left corner of cards (`left-5` aligned with card padding, `pb-2` gap from text). Edit mode shows only the "You are past 100 characters" warning. Empty cards enter edit mode on focus. |
| `src/components/TopBar.tsx` | Replaced `HelpCircle` with `Play` icon for tutorial dropdown toggle. |

## 2025-04-25 — Slice E (continued): Story aggregation

### Summary
Replaced AI-driven story generation with deterministic paragraph aggregation.

### Decisions
- **Deterministic assembly, not creative transformation:** Walking the connection chain backwards and joining each card's content with paragraph breaks (`\n\n`).
- **No AI call needed:** The operation is now synchronous and instant.
- **Button renamed:** "Generate Story" → "Assemble Story" with `FileText` icon to reflect the non-AI nature.
- **Preserves workshop intent:** Each source note becomes its own paragraph, avoiding AI drift.

### Files changed
| File | What changed |
|------|-------------|
| `src/components/Canvas.tsx` | Replaced `handleGenerateStory` with `handleAssembleStory`. Removed AI call. Removed unused `generatingStory` state. Updated button label and icon. |
| `src/services/ai.ts` | `generateTransformationStory` no longer imported in Canvas (still exported for potential future use). |

### Bug fix: Non-linear story assembly
**Problem:** When cards were wired non-linearly (e.g., starting with `point_a → point_b`, then adding `challenge → point_a`), the old backwards walk from a single endpoint could miss branches or stop at false endpoints.

**Fix:** Switched to a forward-walking approach:
1. Build an adjacency map (`from → [to, ...]`) from all connections
2. Find all **root nodes** (cards with no incoming connections)
3. DFS forward from every root to collect every reachable card
4. Sort collected cards by `COLUMN_ORDER` to ensure narrative sequence
5. Assemble each card's content as its own paragraph

This handles any directed graph of connections — linear, branched, or built in any order.

### Files changed
| File | What changed |
|------|-------------|
| `src/components/Canvas.tsx` | Rewrote `handleAssembleStory` with forward DFS from all roots + column-order sort. |

## 2025-04-25 — Connection system fixes

### Summary
Fixed three related issues with the canvas connection system: lines appearing in wrong positions after reload, unreliable node hit detection, and lack of card-to-card connection UX.

### Problems & Fixes

#### 1. Connection lines out of place after reload
**Problem:** `ConnectionLine` only measured DOM positions once via a single `requestAnimationFrame`. After page reload, cards were still animating in (motion.div), so initial measurements were wrong. Pan/zoom changes also weren't reflected.

**Fix:** Replaced single-frame measurement with a continuous `requestAnimationFrame` loop plus `ResizeObserver` on the start node, end node, and board container. Lines now stay accurate through animations, panning, zooming, and layout shifts.

#### 2. Node connections not always working
**Problem:** `handlePointerUp` used `document.elementFromPoint` and checked `el.id.startsWith('node-left-')`. If the pointer landed on a child element (e.g., the inner circle div) instead of the parent with the ID, the connection was silently dropped.

**Fix:** Added `findTargetCardId()` helper that traverses up the DOM tree from the hit element, looking for either a `node-left-*` ID or a `data-card-id` attribute. This ensures connections succeed regardless of which child element is actually hit.

#### 3. Card-to-card connection UX
**Problem:** Users had to hit tiny 16px node circles to create connections.

**Fix:** Added **Shift+drag** card-to-card connections:
- Hold **Shift** and drag from any card body to another card to create a connection
- The card div now has `id={`card-${card.id}`}` so ConnectionLine can anchor to it
- The existing node-based interaction still works for precision connections
- Visual feedback: connection line follows the cursor during the drag

### Files changed
| File | What changed |
|------|-------------|
| `src/components/Canvas.tsx` | Rewrote `ConnectionLine` with continuous rAF loop + ResizeObserver. Rewrote `handlePointerUp` with DOM-tree traversal for hit detection. Added Shift+pointerdown handler on cards for card-to-card connections. Added `id` and `data-card-id` to card divs. |

## 2025-04-25 — Inline card edit mode polish

### Summary
Redesigned card edit mode to look identical to normal display, fixed story card paragraph spacing, and resolved button overlap on new cards.

### Problems & Fixes

#### 1. Chunky edit mode
**Problem:** Edit mode had a boxed textarea with `p-2` padding inside a `p-5` card, plus chunky Save/Cancel buttons that took up space and overlapped the Generate Idea button.

**Fix:**
- Removed Save/Cancel buttons entirely
- Styled the `<textarea>` to look like normal card text:
  - `bg-transparent`, `font-medium leading-snug text-gray-900`
  - No border, no rounded corners, no focus ring
  - `whitespace-pre-wrap`, `resize-none`, `outline-none`
- Character counter stays visible at bottom-left during editing
- Added `Past limit` warning inline with the counter when > 100 chars

**Interaction model:**
- **Enter** → saves and exits edit mode
- **Escape** → cancels, reverts to original text
- **Click outside the card** → cancels via document mousedown listener

#### 2. Textarea not wrapping / text cropped
**Root cause:** `<textarea>` is a scrollable viewport with a fixed intrinsic height (browser default ~2 rows). Unlike a `<div>` which expands to fit content, a textarea clips overflow by default. Previous attempts (removing `rows={1}`, adding `break-words`) didn't address the core issue: the box height was fixed.

**Fix:** Added auto-resize logic:
- `onInput` handler on both textareas sets `height = 'auto'` then `height = scrollHeight + 'px'`
- `useEffect` triggers the same resize whenever `editingCardId` or `editContent` changes (covers initial focus and external updates)
- Added `overflow-hidden` to prevent scrollbars from appearing

Result: textarea now grows and shrinks to match its content, behaving like the reading-mode `<div>`.

#### 3. Story card paragraph spacing lost
**Problem:** `handleAssembleStory` joined paragraphs with `\n\n`, but the display `<div>` collapsed whitespace, so the story looked like one wall of text.

**Fix:** Added `whitespace-pre-wrap` to the card content display `<div>`, so `\n\n` line breaks are actually rendered as blank lines between paragraphs.

#### 4. Button overlap on new cards
**Problem:** New cards started in edit mode with the chunky Save/Cancel div, pushing the Generate Idea button down and causing overlap.

**Fix:** Resolved by removing Save/Cancel buttons. For empty/new cards, the Generate Idea button sits cleanly below the inline textarea with no overlap.

### Files changed
| File | What changed |
|------|-------------|
| `src/components/Canvas.tsx` | Rewrote card content rendering: inline textarea replaces chunky edit UI. Added auto-resize `onInput` + `useEffect`. Added `whitespace-pre-wrap` to content display. Added click-outside-to-cancel. |

### Open follow-ups
- Note synthesis into a new card (RightPanel track)
- Chat apply confirmation / strict edit actions (Slice C)
